            <p class="pt-2" style="text-align: justify; font-size: 19px">The J.B.B Motors has been around for over 60 years, selling tens of thousands of quality used cars to happy customers, from its massive sites across the UK.

                        But the way people shop has changed, even the way they buy their cars, so J.B.B has changed too.

                        The new J.B.B is a website featuring thousands of quality used cars, all available from independent car dealers we know from across the UK, all of whom have been through our rigorous approval process.

                        Which means whatever car you choose on this website, you’re sure to be driving away happy.<br><br>

                        People with excellent credit have usually been at the same address for a long period of time and are registered on the electoral roll. You will have a perfect & long standing credit history showing loan, credit card and mortgage repayments & have no CCJs, defaults or missed payments. You will rarely apply for credit. Some people wait till they’ve found a car before they think about finance, but this can put you on the back foot. By getting your finance approved first you can go to a car dealer with complete confidence, and be in a much stronger position to negotiate a deal. It’s just another way to make sure you drive happy!

                        Apply now with our trust finance partner, CarFinance 24-7.  <br><br>

                       .It’s what J.B.B is all about. We want everyone who finds a car on our website to enjoy complete peace of mind, knowing that the car they’re driving is reliable, great value for money, from a dealer they can trust, and with the best possible finance deal.

                        And if you’re happy, so are we!</p>
